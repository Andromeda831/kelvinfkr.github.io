I am now working on smart cities, community resilience, climate change and energy saving devices and strategies. If you are seeking any form of **academic cooperation**, please feel free to email me at [kelvinfkr2024@outlook.com](mailto:kelvinfkr2024@outlook.com).

I graduated from Tsinghua University with a bachelor's degree in civil engineering advised by [Quanwang Li (李全旺)](https://www.civil.tsinghua.edu.cn/ce/info/1134/1862.htm) and a dual bachelor degress in math advised by [Jun Ye（叶俊）](https://math.tsinghua.edu.cn/info/1099/1746.htm). I graduated with a Ph.D's degree in civil and environmental engineering (CEE) advised by [Ning Lin](https://cee.princeton.edu/people/ning-lin) and did a post doc there also. I also worked as a STEP research fellow under supervison of [Michael Oppenheimer](https://scholar.princeton.edu/oppenheimer) at Center for Policy Research on Energy and the Environment (C-PREE) and Princeton School of Public and International Affairs (SPIA) at Princeton University.

I also collaborate with Young experts: [Wei Ma (马玮)](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/xuta/), [Tao Qin (秦涛)](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/taoqin/) and [Tie-yan Liu (刘铁岩)](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/tyliu/) closely. 

I won the [Baidu Scholarship](https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E7%99%BE%E5%BA%A6%E5%A5%96%E5%AD%A6%E9%87%91/9929412) (10 candidates worldwide each year) and [ByteDance Scholars Program](https://ur.bytedance.com/scholarship) (10 candidates worldwide each year) in 2020 and was selected as one of [the top 100 AI Chinese new stars](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MzA4NzQ5MTA2NA==&mid=2653639431&idx=1&sn=25b6368c1954419b9090840347d9a27d&chksm=8be75b90bc90d286a5af3ef8e610e822d705dc3cf4382b45e3f14489f3e7ec4fd8c95ed0eceb&mpshare=1&scene=2&srcid=0511LMlj9Qv9DeIZAjMjYAU9&sharer_sharetime=1620731348139&sharer_shareid=631c113940cb81f34895aa25ab14422a#rd) and AI Chinese New Star Outstanding Scholar (10 candidates worldwide each year). 

My research interest includes speech synthesis, neural machine translation and automatic music generation. I have published 50+ papers <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=4FA6C0AAAAAJ'><img src="https://img.shields.io/endpoint?logo=Google%20Scholar&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.jsdelivr.net%2Fgh%2FRayeRen%2Frayeren.github.io@google-scholar-stats%2Fgs_data_shieldsio.json&labelColor=f6f6f6&color=9cf&style=flat&label=citations"></a> at the top international AI conferences such as NeurIPS, ICML, ICLR, KDD. 

To promote the communication among the Chinese ML & NLP community, we (along with other 11 young scholars worldwide) founded the [MLNLP community](https://space.bilibili.com/168887299) in 2021. I am honored to be one of the chairs of the MLNLP committee.
